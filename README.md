# Tesla Battery Range Calculator in Vue

### Getting started
* `yarn` To install all the dependencies for this Hackjam. If you don't have yarn installed, install it via `npm i yarn`
* `yarn start` To start the website locally.
* Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) To see the website running, full of bugs :)

### First things first

We've left a few bugs in the website, that you'll have to fix in order to understand the basic concepts of Vue.js

The main.js file is the entry point of the site, it is here that your first component is mounted and rendered.

### App.vue

This is the first component mounted by Vue. Fix the errors in this file before moving :)
The logo seems to be missing, try using the data()
